Sunny Screenshot‘s translations `*.ts` files

> If you are interested, you can help with the internationalisation of this project!

This is the internationalised translation file (.ts) of Sunny's screenshot.

You can use Notepad to edit, or [Qt Linguist](https://github.com/lelegard/qtlinguist-installers/releases) to translate.

When the text file *.ts is translated, I will merge it into the programme and release it in the next version. Subsequently, the submission of translated documents will also be optimised and more detailed programme descriptions will be improved.
